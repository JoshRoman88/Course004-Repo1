git add file
git stash
*Do other work, add, commit*
git stash pop
*Work on original file, add, commit*
git push


git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your 
working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. 
 Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, 
 but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
