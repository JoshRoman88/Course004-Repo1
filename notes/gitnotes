Trunk vs Branch Dev:

Branch is seen more in larger teams and/or large projects. 
Allows features to be implemented as they are reviewed and completed.
Issues:
Can have conflicting errors as the main branch is updated with new commits and pushes.



git branch commands:
git branch - shows current branches
git branch <name of branch> - creates branch

git checkout <name of branch> - to work in branch
git switch <branch name> - change branches

An error will pop when trying to push while in the branch. The proper command will display - copy and use that command.
git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>

deleting branch from local machine:
git switch main - Cannot be in the branch you are deleting.
git branch -d <branch name>

Branch to merge flow:
Dev creates branch
Dev completes task, adds, commits, and push (the branch way)

Go to github (mothership)
