What I learned:
Trunk based dev - version control managment practice where developers merge small, frequent updates to the main branch(trunk).

Keeps featured branch short.
*Feature braches separate work that is in production from those pushed to the main/master branch*

Idea is to find problems earlier to potentially prevent overlapping in merges of code.
Can speed up delivery and oganizational performance.

Attempts to keep pieces in one enviorment. Those pieces are sent to a release enviorment for review.



Questions:
What is a development cycle and how does it vary(if at all) with different groups?
How many people are needed for each stage for average project?

Is this best practice for small teams? It sounds like it can get complicated with a large team.
